# Easy Encryptor
## What is it?
This is a closs platform Open Source project that intends to allow for the easiest possible single file encryption. The user will have acess to an easy to use GUI that allows them to selects files to encrypt, store the encyrpted files in the location they choose, and also allows for the user to decrypt files using a key that is generated and stored at the time of encryption.

## How can I get it?
To get this application to run on your computer, you will need to clone the repository to your computer and then run 'npm start' in the directory you just downloaded.

## Problems/new features?
I will no longer be maintaining this project, so any questions and bug fixes will have to be taken up by the community. Also, if you are looking for some inspiration for new ideas on how to contribute to this project, adding new levels of difficulty for encryption would be a start, and trying to implement some deciphering algorithms to decrypt the lower level encryptions without a key would be really cool as well!

## Comment style?
For spacing I like the tabs set to 2 whitespaces.
For comments, at least one comment above every method.
But, since I am no longer maintaining this project, once you fork your own branch, you can really do whatever you want!
